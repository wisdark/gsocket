GSOCKET works on Linux, FreeBSD, macOS, Cygwin and many others. If the particular OS is not listed here then try the *Install Script* or *compile from source*.

***Static Binary***

The [deploy instructions](https://www.gsocket.io/deploy/) are the fastest way to install gsocket. Some people say it's the **_World's smallest backdoor_**.

A stripped down version of just gs-netcat (without blitz, gs-mount, gs-ftp, ...) and no help (`--help`) is available as [pre-compiled static binary](https://github.com/hackerschoice/binary/tree/main/gsocket/bin).
